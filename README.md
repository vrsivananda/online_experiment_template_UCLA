## This is a template for online experiments that I created for the lab at UCLA.


### (1) sample_experiment
-- Allows the researcher to fit their code into the template to run it on psiTurk and collect data into the MySQL database
-- Please read the README.md file for instructions on what you need to change

### (2) data_analysis folder
-- Allows researcher to download the data from the MySQL database and analyze it
